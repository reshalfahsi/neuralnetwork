# Artificial Neural Network 
This repository contain implementation of Artificial Neural Network Algorithm in several programming languanges and frameworks. This repository was created to introduce artifical neural network in a simple way. Artificial Neural Network has become popular at this time. This branch field of Artificial Intelligence has given powerful impact to our daily life such as social media recomendation system, face detection of camera on phone and many more. Therefore to keep up our knowledge in technology especially Artificial Intelligence, we have to understand the concept of Artificial Neural Network.
